# Winfile_STEPUP
STEPUP add-on for original Windows File Manager (winfile.exe). Created by WinAbility '94-99.

'Stepup' was perhaps the one & only add-on for Windows File Manager back in the Windows 95/98/Windows NT days.
Remember, this was years before Windows XP and even Windows 2000.
It was written by WinAbility (winability.com). Performing a google search on it now brings back lame honeypot viral robotised websites; nowhere can you find a simple download of the software. Here it is, compressed within RAR. Download, uncompress, install & re-run winfile.exe and you have a new menu 'stepup' with extra functions.


fmviewv2.0regfile.zip is WinAbilities second add-on for the original 95/NT/ File Manager. It is a file and photo viewer add-on for File Manager.
Guaranteed that this does not exist anywhere else on the internet!


File Manager (winfile.exe) can be grabbed from any Windows NT CD (recommended from NT SP6a as it is the most recent). 
Works out of the box in Windows XP.  XP did not come with winfile.exe
Windows Vista and above requires further installs, all being in : winfile_vista.zip


Sometime in 2020 or so, Microsoft re-vamped Winfile for Windows 10 & 11.
The project was abandoned six months ago. It can be also found on Github somewhere. Im not interested, so haven't bothered going loooking for the URL.
