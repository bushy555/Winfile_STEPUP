# Winfile_STEPUP
STEPUP add-on for original Windows File Manager (winfile.exe). Created by WinAbility '94-99.

'Stepup' was perhaps the one & only add-on for Windows File Manager back in the Windows 95/98/Windows NT days.
Remember, this was years before Windows XP and even Windows 2000.
It was written by WinAbility (winability.com). Performing a google search on it now brings back lame honeypot viral robotised websites; nowhere can you find a simple download of the software. Here it is, compressed within RAR. Download, uncompress, install & re-run winfile.exe and you have a new menu 'stepup' with extra functions.
